## Ingredients

#### Filling
- 1 can of chickpeas 
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp of your favourite mustard
- 1 tbsp tahini (alternative: unsweetened hazelunt/almond butter, or even sesame
  or olive oil)
- 2 tbsp mayo (alternative: vegan remoulade, which is what I use)

#### Rice
- 2 cups of sushi rice
- 3 cups of water
- salt
- a bunch of nori sheets

## Method 

It's good to make rice a bit ahead of time, like in the morning. 99.99% of the
time I forget to do this, so I wrap my Onigiri in hot rice, which is kind of
hard. So don't be me, and set rice a bit earlier so it cools. 

To make rice, boil hot water in a kettle. Set another pot for rice and heat it
up a bit. Add rice to the heated pot, stir it a bit, and fill it up with boiled
water. Lower heat to the minimum and set a timer for 20min. When done, rice
should be a bit sticky. 

For filling, mash chickpeas with a fork or a potato masher thingy. Add the
remaining filling ingredients and mix. Give it a taste, sometimes I adjust for salt
(more soy sauce), or tanginess and tartness (more mustard and mayo).

I have a little mold that helps me shape these. However! There is this [nice
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOyJs1U5nCQ) that shows you how to do it without help of molds. 

Regardless of how you mold, wrap nori around your finished onigiri so it's nice
and easy to hold and eat.
